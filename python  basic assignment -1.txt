1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be
integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.

Ans:   *     : expressions(its a mathematical operators)
     'hello' :value(Its a string)
      -87.8  :value(Its a integer)
      -      :expression(mathematical operators)
      /      :expression(mathematical operators)
      +      :expression(mathematical operators)
      6      :values(integer)


2. What is the difference between string and variable?

Ans: Stirng
	It is a datatype 
	Strings are immutable
     
	Variable
	  Its is used to assign a values the stored data can be int,float  str etc..

3. Describe three different data types.

	
       1 int - it is used to represent the integer values eg :a=1,b=3

	2.flaot - its used to represent the decimal values eg: a=4.34
	
	3.string= it is used to represent the characters  eg :a="haiii"




4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?


    Expresssion 
  		It is used to perform some mathematical operations	

	Expression is used to get some result 



5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an
expression and a statement?

	 - Difference : The difference is that expression itself is assigned to a variable or constant. 




6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1


Ans:      bacon=22
	  bacon+1
	  print(bacon)   == output will be= 22




7. What should the values of the following two terms be?

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans:  Because variable names cannot begin with a number

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string
version of a value?
Ans:  integer=int()
      float= float()	
      string=str()


10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
' I have eaten '+99+ 'burritos'
Ans Here  we cannot concantinate a string and a integer
